# Double Pendulum Simulation
Developed and designed desktop app in python to visualize, create and interact a simulator of the movements of a double
pendulum for what it was necessary to study all the physics and math behind and then implemented. Also, it has an
graphic interface to change the weights, lengths and angle of starting of the simulation.
